#It's Time to Take Another Look At Hybrid Mobile Apps
Ok, I will admit it, I'm a native guy. XCode is my tool of choice. Typically when I hear people discuss hybrid apps I have a habit of turning up my nose. *Hmm, why not just write it in Swift. It's faster. It's easier, and generally better.* I mumble to myself. But I have to admit, over the past year a lot has changed in the Hybrid mobile space that really makes its a solid option for development. Much of this resurgence comes down to the evolution of JavaScript, but also in how new hybrid app models are emerging.

##Performance
Back in the day, JavaScript used to perform poorly on mobile devices. This is no longer the case. With Android now supporting  WebViews based on Chromium (plus auto-updates) and Apple's WKWebView API which provides access to the Nitro JIT compiler, JavaScript is fast! I still wouldn't use it for a really graphically intensive app, but let's face it, if you are building apps for business, what you really need is portability rather than graphics speed.

##Portability
The Hybrid mobile app is typically associated most with being able to run a single code base across multiple devices. The reality is that building such an app at scale is very difficult. At [Salesforce](http://salesforce.com), it took us a number of false starts to build the Salesforce1 mobile app container. If you are building apps with multiple teams, portability also means disparate teams have to be able to work independently, but on common components. To solve this problem, we created the [Aura Framework](http://documentation.auraframework.org/auradocs#). Aura allows development teams to build and consume components based on design-by-contract principles. 

Perhaps the best known story in portability is [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com). It underpins many hybrid apps, including [Salesforce1](http://www.salesforce.com/mobile/overview/). Things are still pretty fragmented here with [Phone Gap Build](https://build.phonegap.com), Telerik's [AppBuilder](http://www.telerik.com/appbuilder), [Xamarin](https://xamarin.com), plus others offering tools to deliver apps for multiple platforms. I don't see a clear front runner yet. Time will tell if a dominent alternative to PhoneGap emerges.  

Beyond managing the build/deploy aspect of hybrid mobile apps, there  has also been a slew of web  component frameworks providing portability at the UI layer. I've been particularly impressed with [Google's Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/starter-kit/?hl=en) and [Polymer Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/polymer-starter-kit/?hl=en). Both of these provide a comprehensive approach to web apps, that work well on mobile. And, of course, I can't miss mentioning [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) from Facebook. React is blowing up right now, but you have to remember it is a UI framework only. You still need to consider mobile backends.

##JavaScript Backends
My first exposure to JavaScript as backends for mobile apps came via [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and microservices running on [Heroku](http://heroku.com). The general idea is to create a series of independent apps, or services, that expose end points to be consumed by mobile apps, generally via HTTP and RESTful interfaces. I've written a bunch of mobile apps with this pattern. [HomeSwiper](https://github.com/quintonwall/HomeSwiper), for example, is a native Swift app that retrieves a list of properties from a Node.js backend to provide the user a Tinder-like swiping experience to browse real estate listings. But I consider this sort of JavaScript backend designed for full stack developers familiar with the latest technology. For a business who may not have a bench of Node developers, or a individual just learning to code, a full stack mobile app is a lot to learn and get started with.

[Parse](http://www.parse.com) provides a great developer experience for creating databases and cloud logic that mobile developers can consume, effectively freeing the developer from much of the effort of standing up a backend for mobile apps. Since [it's acquisition by Facebook](http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/25/facebook-parse/) in April of 2013, however, Parse seems to have lost steam. My money is on [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com). Meteor is approaching JavaScript app dev as full platform similar to how Heroku approached Ruby development when it first launched. Meteor is definitely a technology to watch.

##The New Hybrid Model
I've talked primarily about JavaScript and how it's powering the next generation of hybrid mobile apps. But, these new hybrid apps  is much more than JavaScript in a container. The lines between what is JavaScript and HTML5 vs. what is Native code is becoming increasingly blurred. The new hybrid model allows developers to build in technologies they are familiar with, or best suited for a specific task, and combine them into a single mobile app. You could think of the new hybrid model as front end microservices. 

[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) is a great example of the new hybrid model. React Native allows developers to build apps using their knowledge of React.js, but interacts with native code to run on either iOS or Android with full async execution. Further, because you are writing in JavaScript, you can use the Chrome Developer tools to debug your app. React Native is definitely an area I am watching closely.

Now don't think for a minute, the other big players are getting into the new hybrid model too. [Venturepact](http://blog.venturepact.com/8-high-performance-apps-you-never-knew-were-hybrid/) has a great piece on 8 high performance apps you never knew were hybrid. Much of this pieces discusses the performance improvements of late, but the model I am most interested in is represented in Apple's App Store App. This is where I believe hybrid apps will go.

The Apple App Store app is a native app that uses native elements for navigation, search, and I suspect relies heavily on native iOS technology such as storyboards for app navigation. But the App Store app also relies heavily on webviews to present dynamic content. HTML was originally designed as a markup language for content. It still performs fantastically for this function. 

##Summary
The new hybrid app model will blend the best of native and the best of web to deliver killer mobile app experiences. Developers will be able to use hot frameworks like React, Polymer, or native elements like toolbars and storyboards, all whilst leveraging cloud-based  app platforms like Meteor , Heroku, and Parse. It's pretty clear the next generation of hybrid mobile apps is here. It's time to take another look.
